As explained in the previous earnings call, BSE set aside a provision of approximately Rs. 200 crores with BSE directly contributing Rs. 53 crores to the SGF and ICCL Rs. 147 crores. Subsequently, ICCL on receiving approval from SEBI utilized surplus funds lying in the currency segment, which led to the reversal of the provision on ICCL's part. For the Quarter 4 FY '25, BSE has contributed an amount of Rs. 37.6 crores towards NSE Clearing Ltd. (NCL) leading to a net reversal of Rs. 109 crores.",

    "text": "When I look at the options market, what I am seeing is there is a sort of a consolidation that is happening. From more of an expiry date product, which most of the contracts were trading, because of the multiplicity, and also because of every one day one expiry, the total economic purpose typically which any contract serves, whereby it provides the capability for people to take a directional view ahead of an event, so as to safeguard what is getting lost. With this consolidation more which has been brought in, rightfully by the regulatory process, today makes the options product somewhat getting more mature than what it was. In the case of BSE, we are clearly seeing that it is no longer an expiry day product. It is spread across the weeks. Therefore, people are able to take a view on market not just for the expiry day, but ahead of it next week, next to next week, next month, etc. If this trend continues, if more products on a monthly basis were to be looked at, then I feel the option industry will be growing more towards an alignment with the underlying market and underlying portfolios, which in my opinion could be a healthier development. Also, if you look at it from an infrastructure perspective, if it is every day expiry, every day the infrastructure being stretched to the maximum, in terms of huge and significant number of orders coming in, resulting in not so many trades, but lesser number of trades, in a way hogging the infrastructure, tiring it, increasing the infrastructure cost for no gain economically, probably gets addressed by this rationalization that the regulators have brought in. So, this is the direction I see. I therefore see more meaningful use of options, more meaningful products continuing to grow in the coming future is what I am able to see as a result of all the actions.",

While India cannot remain immune to these developments, the progress achieved on the disinflation front gives headroom to monetary policies to focus on balancing the growth-inflation outcome.

I'm not saying we are perfect, but we are much better than many of the channels in terms of disclosure assessment. And what that implies is our claims book is standing strong. And what that means is the insurers are not getting surprises as much as they may be getting in some other channels. And thus, we feel lesser pressure than maybe the market feels on both the claim settlement side as well as some of our, you know, payouts, etc., right? And I think one of the things is because over the last three years, we have worked so hard on ensuring customers get their claims, some of our own renewal claim ratios will also start to move upwards, right? Because, obviously, we were not able to put as much effort in in that. And we will be getting in the same range or maybe just lower, a tad lower than other channels because we are putting in that effort, but that is coming at a much higher claim settlement than many other areas.

So, we decide to build a factory only after we have confidence in the booking numbers. Once we book the orders and we know that we have to deliver, only then we go ahead and build the factories. And the factory that we have in the US, as well as the factories that we have, frankly, anywhere, including our Chikhli, which is the largest facility, is built on the back of a very strong order book. And so the confidence that we have, and that's the reason why we have been able to give the guidance, right, for our EBITDA, stems out of an order book, which we are very, very confident about. Our customers are clearly needing all of these panels and we are ensuring that we are able to deliver it to them. In fact, the execution need inside our organization now is to -- and since it's IPL season going on, is to really consider almost every day as an over and to make sure that we are actually hitting the manufacturing numbers every day to meet our customers' requirements.",

Revenues in FY24 were the highest, but footfalls were highest in FY23, right after COVID. So, we haven’t been able to maintain that growth in footfalls. What we are seeing now is that we've probably come to a new normal in terms of footfalls. And I think from this year onwards, we can expect some mild growth, especially in our tenured parks. We're not expecting huge growth in footfalls from those, since they've been around for many years. Mild growth is all we can expect from existing parks. New parks, of course, will see a bigger ramp",

What's important to realize is there is for some products some makeup capacity elsewhere to source your goods, but there are also certain goods where alternatives are either non-existent or fairly limited. Therefore, there is a strong dependency on getting these goods from China, whether it is semiconductors, something as simple as snowboard boots, or other products where the supply chains are very verticalized in China, same with solar panels or battery parts.",

While some merchants have raised prices, we haven't seen broad based price increases yet. However, there remains a mix of strategies at play to navigate tariffs beyond just pricing. Merchants are considering when to change sourcing countries, when to buy inventory, or even adjusting product mix in their catalogs. From an end buyer perspective, in 2024, we had over 875,000,000 unique online shoppers, spanning a broad range of income levels and brand loyalties. While all merchants proudly serve consumers across all income brackets, their buyer base skews towards higher income consumers with more than half of their buyers in The US having incomes exceeding a hundred thousand dollars.

S, the outlook for the global economy has become more uncertain. Are closely monitoring the developments and continuously analyzing the potential impact. At the same time, we are taking proactive steps to mitigate those. We are at Siemens Energy not immune to tariffs as we have a global supply chain and trade flows into The United States from the rest of the world. It is also important to get a better understanding of the secondary trade policy effects on GDP and energy demand and tertiary effects such as potential changes in customer behaviors. Besides the direct financial implications, those new tariffs and regulations will add bureaucratic hurdles to the import process for authorities and importers.",

As on date, generally there are no incentives in place for any player, whether it is a state player or a private player, to incentivize early completion of projects. So that is one area which we hope to target in the days to come. The second is the option of refinancing. The option of refinancing, once scheduled, COD (Commercial Operation Date) has been achieved.

So that is where the premium has come down and it has come down by more than 50-60% because the exposure is less, the insurance companies try to pass on the benefit on the premium front to the state insurers. For example, for a state like Maharashtra where the premium goes up to ₹10-12,000 crores they have now opted for SSM model wherein the loss cap is kept at 110%.

Since then, political and macroeconomic volatility has increased even further. Due to ongoing developments and negotiations, the expected effects from tariffs on 2025 results can only be estimated based on certain assumptions. So we have taken the latest impacts as of May 5th, meaning tariffs on US imports of CPU [Central Processing Unit] and non USMCA [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] components at an additional 25%. But on the other hand, the executive order from last week regarding non-stacking and the eligibility of 3.7% of MSRP [Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price] for the Spartanburg production volume has some positive impact given our strong local footprint in the US and the extremely high tariffs for imports from the US to China is negligible given we also have a strong local footprint in China. In particular, the localization of the X5 in 2022 helps mitigating and still the tariff increases that started to come into effect from early March will have a notable impact on the Q2 results. We assume that some of the tariff increases as of May 5th or up to May 5th will be temporary and that there will be reductions from July 2025.",
