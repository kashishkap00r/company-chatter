    "text": "I would now like to address the reversal of Rs. 109 crores reflected in our P&L statement for the current quarter under contribution to core SGF. As explained in the previous earnings call, BSE set aside a provision of approximately Rs. 200 crores with BSE directly contributing Rs. 53 crores to the SGF and ICCL Rs. 147 crores. Subsequently, ICCL on receiving approval from SEBI utilized surplus funds lying in the currency segment, which led to the reversal of the provision on ICCL's part. For the Quarter 4 FY '25, BSE has contributed an amount of Rs. 37.6 crores towards NSE Clearing Ltd. (NCL) leading to a net reversal of Rs. 109 crores.” \"We provided Rs.200 crores towards SGF earlier... SEBI allowed the use of currency derivatives SGF for normal SGF... We reversed provision on ICCL’s part. Rs.37 crores contributed towards NCL recently... SGF is complex; straight linear projection difficult... we are exploring periodic provisioning to improve predictability.",

    "text": "When I look at the options market, what I am seeing is there is a sort of a consolidation that is happening. From more of an expiry date product, which most of the contracts were trading, because of the multiplicity, and also because of every one day one expiry, the total economic purpose typically which any contract serves, whereby it provides the capability for people to take a directional view ahead of an event, so as to safeguard what is getting lost. With this consolidation more which has been brought in, rightfully by the regulatory process, today makes the options product somewhat getting more mature than what it was. In the case of BSE, we are clearly seeing that it is no longer an expiry day product. It is spread across the weeks. Therefore, people are able to take a view on market not just for the expiry day, but ahead of it next week, next to next week, next month, etc. If this trend continues, if more products on a monthly basis were to be looked at, then I feel the option industry will be growing more towards an alignment with the underlying market and underlying portfolios, which in my opinion could be a healthier development. Also, if you look at it from an infrastructure perspective, if it is every day expiry, every day the infrastructure being stretched to the maximum, in terms of huge and significant number of orders coming in, resulting in not so many trades, but lesser number of trades, in a way hogging the infrastructure, tiring it, increasing the infrastructure cost for no gain economically, probably gets addressed by this rationalization that the regulators have brought in. So, this is the direction I see. I therefore see more meaningful use of options, more meaningful products continuing to grow in the coming future is what I am able to see as a result of all the actions.",

So, it's more a chemistry marvel what we have put, looking at innovation which comes in the formulation. That's point one. Second, warranty becomes a de facto correlation to the quality of the product. So, it's not necessary that every customer will look at five years or ten years or fifteen years of repainting. But it becomes definitely a strong correlation with respect to how you perceive the quality of the product. And it gives you an assurance that if this product is going to be talking of this kind of a warranty, it's looking at possibly giving me this kind of durability over a period of time. So, we think the relationship of the customer with the warranty is very strong. And in fact, Asian Paints were the first one to introduce warranties about 20 years back when we started looking at all these warranties coming into picture.

As already reported in the last call, the company had been forced to cool down its furnace due to a slow demand, lower level of operations, and a write-off of non-moving inventories of about 16 crores.

This looks promising for the domestic manufacturing of solar photovoltaic modules. However, final concrete steps are still awaited.

Next, the elimination of both Russian and Ukrainian coal tar from the historic European supply pool, due to a combination of factors, has greatly limited the availability of traditional coal tar raw materials in Europe. Lastly, the recessionary trend, which has stemmed from the war in Ukraine, has resulted in high energy prices and shifting supply chains. These changes have increased costs and forced steel mill rationalizations in Europe over the last few years, further exacerbating the coal tar supply situation.

Now, industry might be going through its various, I don’t think there’s anything too unusual about when I was handling, before my previous assignment, a very large portfolio as well. I think we have always had these situations of MSMEs - always have to be very well risk-calibrated. I don’t see any storm in the industry in my assessment. These storms have always existed if you don’t calibrate it well. So, to blame the industry is not something I see that way. I see that if you’ve got to be well risk-calibrated, and the industry is what it was, I don’t think there’s a deterioration in the industry level, and I am not a large enough size to comment on it.

So, we have done it from Quarter 4 itself. In vehicle finance, they have been continuously improving their underwriting models. So, those are important things, and we also mentioned that this year is actually a year of collection, not the year of disbursement. So, we are trying our level best to ensure our first bucket collection is actually very good and roll forward rates are lower. And if you continue to do that, then obviously we will start getting benefit from quarter 3 onwards and in terms of the loan losses are concerned, loan losses are actually not because of the current collection. It is also because of the roll forward that happened in the past.

So majority of the cost involved is all related to logistics and can be a function of the performance of various sea routes in terms of how their pricing is faring is one of the basic impact of that. So the costing is majorly on the logistics and logistics management side which is predominantly what is on the costing. Regarding to your question and there are some taxes also in terms of to the government which has to be paid as royalties on the export so that also exists. So that is also as the some percentage of the total cost.",

And because of the global chain disruption, sometimes it happens that some of these raw materials that go into production of materials, alloys are not available in time. So it will put stress on us sometimes. Suppose say, for example, some materials or some strains are not available or some pure elements which we use in the manufacturing of these nickel-based super alloys, even if one element is not there, like typically a super alloy consists of six to seven elements. Absence of any one of the elements is going to be a critical thing. And one of our objectives is also to develop some domestic market, but it takes time. It will not happen immediately because these are all long, I mean, very heavy investments are required for making these elements, okay, whatever we import, if you want to make within the country, it takes time. So short term, yes, we want to meet the targets. And long term, we want to have some collaborations and all, how to recover, maybe some of these alloy elements if they are possible to recycle and use, that also we are looking.

That keeps going up given the deployment opportunity they have. Now with the new rules which is now as a discussion paper and maybe will get finalized where the limits have been increased to INR 1,500-10,000 crores, and limit will be monitored on a delta-adjusted open interest basis, there are flexible rules on index futures and market-wide, open position will also be linked to cash volume. So, this has removed a lot of uncertainty because the regulators also took feedback from most of these international clients who operate in this market. And more importantly, the intraday peak has been removed from being a limit than to monitoring, which is there in most of the developed markets in the world.

So, what we've done is replace effectively lower volume B2C bookings with high-value corporate bookings. The margins and the absolute realization on corporate travel are significantly higher than on B2C part of it. And because of that, you see while volumes have dropped the gross bookings have improved and the earnings have improved much more meaningfully. So, it's an attempt on our part to rebalance our business more towards corporate, which has been in line with our strategic initiatives, right, and our strategic approach that we've adopted for the last 2 years. So, this is a continuation of that same trend only. As I mentioned in my opening remarks as well, we are now at a stage where about 65% of our gross bookings are coming from our corporate and B2B part of our business.

More than 70% of our transactions are done by the customers using this platform. This platform then deeply integrates into the ERP systems, into the HRMS systems of the organizations, the company's approval process mechanism and purchasing flow for travel sits on our platform. And from there, then it will go seamlessly integrate into an expense management solution as well for people to claim their expenses on trip. So that's the solution that we are offering. On the fintech side, while today, it's still relatively early days for the expense management , I think expense management combined with credit cards and credit cloud-led payment solutions are increasingly growing opportunity in the Indian corporate landscape. More and more companies want to move away from handing out imprest and cash and automate all of that, using prepaid card instruments or prepaid wallets or credit card and credit card-led wallets. So that's what we are working on at this point of time. And this will be the next stage, which will be there at some point in the second half of the current fiscal year.” “So, on the expense management and card solutions, I'm a lot more bullish on that, right? I do see that as a very healthy opportunity. And if I look at this 3 to 5 years down the road, I do think that from an income point of view, one third of our income could potentially come from these, and the expense management solution could be not just an India-focused solution but will be a combination of India plus international markets.",

So, on the corporate side as well for hotels , the same actually holds true because of a timing difference.

I think there is a lot on our plate at this point of time with the glassware plant, with newer channels of sales, which are becoming very disruptive. So I think there is a lot of stuff that we can still do with what we have. And eventually, yes, we will keep entering different, different segments because in India, after a certain point, every vertical becomes very saturated very quickly because either there are too many players or there is saturation in terms of consumer demand.",

So, this time what we did, and regulators also accepted, in case of parking charges, which used to be flat after 2.5 hours, we have now made it a multiplier. So, for 2 hours and up to 4 hours there is a particular rate, and beyond 4 hours up to 8 hours is double of it and beyond 8 hours it is 4x. So we wanted to dissuade the airlines not to park the aircraft for long because it will be creating congestion. As a result of that, the parking charges have substantially gone up and the revenues, because there are so many aircrafts which have been parked, now they are slowly, slowly taking out and they are doing much more faster turnaround. So, in the initial 3 to 6 months, they have now learned it. Going forward, that additional revenue we may not generate, but because of the parking charges, additional revenue has come and the yield per pax has gone up. However, as per the tariff determination, it is INR360 yield per pax, that will continue to be there. So, in the next quarter also, we may have a little more because of parking, maybe by fourth quarter onwards, we may come back to 360 or 365.

There will not be a resistance to stock material as there is no threat of an inventory loss for the channel partners as well. So that is the one positive. I think we will see a stable price environment and affordability in PVC. As far as ADD is concerned, there has been a lot of talk about ADD since, you know, past two or three quarters. I prefer not to speculate on this things because this is related to the government and the DGTR. Whenever it comes, I think PVC will continue to be range-bound, but you will see a recovery. So whatever PVC today is maybe around Rs.70 per kg, this could move to around Rs.75 to Rs.80 a kg. So you could see a slight uptick, but again, I don't see a major irrational upward movement of PVC.

The kind of capacities that are being put up, whether it's by MNCs or by local players, there is very aggressive capacity addition. You are going to see very affordable CPVC raw material and as a result finished good pricing over the next 3-4 years. I think this goes back to, you know, decades ago when this happened with PVC as well, which led to a mass consumption of PVC across the country. And today India is one of the largest consumers of PVC. I think we are on that kind of a cusp for CPVC. I think this is just the start in terms of the acceptance of CPVC and the consumption of CPVC across multiple applications, be it plumbing, firefighting, and industrial. I believe again, this is a very sensitive use case for the builder. It goes in the concealed application for hot and cold water plumbing. So, today, you know, 80% of the market is with top four of us. And I don't see any major shifts. Yes, there will be access to smaller players, but I think this is an extremely brand conscious segment and a very sensitive use case because it goes into concealed application for hot and cold water plumbing. So I think there is net-net, there is more to gain than to lose for a large player like us who already has, let's say more than 10% market share in this segment. You know, we are aggressively adding capacity and we are extremely bullish on the growth of CPVC over the next few years.",

    "text": "Delhivery has always been more than 100% of the profit pool of this industry. That position has only been strengthened over the last financial year. As we mentioned before, at the pricing that currently prevails in the market, Delhivery is the only profitable player in this industry and to the best of our understanding our remaining competitors with model similar to Ecom Express have also seen an expansion in their losses in Q4, which means our competitive positioning continues to be better. I have been public about this. There were too many players in this market in the previous quarter. Our acquisition of Ecom Express has not changed that dynamic. There are still too many players in this market. And in terms of what exactly will happen as I've mentioned, you know, how long can unprofitable players continue to survive in this market is a question that I am not best placed to answer. I think the reality is it depends on how much capital they have left. But I think what this deal has done is it does signal that if you are a loss-making network in Express Parcel with no path to profitability, consolidation or exit is an inevitable outcome. So I think we're very happy. Our position will continue to improve. As you can see from our cost advantages, they are not theoretical, they are material. Our service advantages are material because customers don't reward you merely for having the lowest cost. And at the end of the day, we will continue to grind our way through these advantages and make sure there is very limited, if any breathing room for any competitors in this space.",

    "text": "In terms of volumes and retained volumes, our assumptions on retained volumes were fairly conservative to begin with. Our assumption was that we would retain close to about 30% of the volumes of the Ecom Express standalone network. From the time that the deal was under consideration up to now in May, we've already seen an organic uptick in the volumes of Delhivery's standalone Express Parcel network. As you can see, our Jan. Feb. daily average volumes are represented by the black dotted line on the left. From there going into March, we saw an uptick in overall volumes as customers began to shift some of their volumes into the Delhivery network. On formal announcement of the deal, this has continued and has been solidified. The trend in April was marginally higher than the trend in March, which in itself is a new phenomenon. Generally speaking, Q1 volumes are soft, and April volumes tend to come in below March volumes. So this is a positive sign. And May volumes on average have been higher than both April and March volumes as well. So overall, I think from a volume retention standpoint, we remain highly satisfied.",

Hopefully, as you can see, the Q4 numbers, which have come in at 10.8%, and we brought up several times that as the business gets closer to about 175,000 to 200,000 tons of freight, we hit nearly full potential margins.

Now this, of course, is a bit dependent on how much growth we see organically in the market for us post the acquisition, but to put certain numbers in perspective, when we look at e-comm's DRHP, I think they filed that they have capacity to do about 120 million shipment sorts per month, whereas the volume retention that we have factored in our valuation would basically mean that we are retaining roughly only about 15 million per month. And let's assume there are two sorts. There are 30 million sorts per month. So in a sense, about 35 million shipments per month additional parcel sorting capacity. That's a broad number. Now over a period of two or three years as this growth adds on to the business, we should not require to buy parcel sortation systems, we will require to buy bag sortation systems for our PTL and integrated PTL and B2C bag sorting at that point.",

I've gone into this in extreme detail over the last two years. The fundamental logic hasn't changed. Wherever these self logistics arms are being run for non-financial reasons, in that situation, I suppose they can continue for any length of time. So nothing is fundamentally altered.

There's no bunker, right? And that bunker is going to come into play at the end of H1 this year. And once that happens, your oncology business which even currently is in, is not anywhere near the oncology business of the rest of the hospital, there's a major move up over there. If you look at Nagpur for example, we're already now approaching very high capacity utilization. The teams are coming in play and so on and so forth. We're already looking at the next phase which is, you know, adding another 160-150 beds over there. So once that happens, it gives you a major fillip because you know you don't have any capacity left over there. As far as Max Noida is concerned, you're operating at, you know, we bought a unit which is operating at less than 50% occupancy.

I will just take you back, I am assuming you will be about 35 years, if you just go back to your younger days. People used to buy CDs, people used to buy cassettes, even for pirated music, people would go to a next-door shop and pay Rs.100 to get their own playlist. So, it's not that people have not paid for music earlier days. People have always paid. If you look at you bought a CD of Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham for about Rs.300 or Rs.500 also. And today you are getting almost Rs.700, or Rs.600 for our cost a full library, global library at a click of a button, at a convenience different playlist. So, I don't it's about value, because it has been available for free, people have not been valuing it. As services stop that will be a hockey stick growth for the industry, and that's where music labels also believe in. The future lies in subscription and not doesn't lie in the freemium. You have seen the advertising headwinds across the media are being there. So, there is no way a medium can sustain only on advertising. The subscriber growth will play it, we saw in video OTT in the COVID times, the way the growth happened, and we believe that similar numbers will happen here, also. Now coming to competition, Spotify started putting lot of restrictions on free product, even if you look at YouTube also, when you watch anything on YouTube, there is so much of ads now coming on YouTube that they are also looking at paying more focus on subscription. In fact, YouTube music, if you are not a paid subscriber, will not play music in the background. So that itself is a nudge to grow some subscribers. Even Saavn is looking at that, so it's a very healthy thing there is, as I said, if everybody goes paid, the headroom is because 200 million people does subscribe music free. So, there is no way people may not subscribe to this and, as I said, the last EY report says about only 15 million pay. So, the amount of growth opportunity which is available for all the players is massive. So, I am very, very confident, very optimistic it's great business, a great time to be in.

[KEY REMARK] Technically, increasing our business with IKEA by three times. I'm proud to announce, in principle, we have awarded this RFQ award, and subject to approval process of the quality standards. Our company had taken preventative actions by already capacity building and ordering the molds required to enhance this capacity.

Policybazaar is in a phenomenal position there because we have done very good disclosure assessment at the beginning and it's always comparative, right? I'm not saying we are perfect, but we are much better than many of the channels in terms of disclosure assessment. And what that implies is our claims book is standing strong. And what that means is the insurers are not getting surprises as much as they may be getting in some other channels. And thus, we feel lesser pressure than maybe the market feels on both the claim settlement side as well as some of our, you know, payouts, etc., right? And I think one of the things is because over the last three years, we have worked so hard on ensuring customers get their claims, some of our own renewal claim ratios will also start to move upwards, right? Because, obviously, we were not able to put as much effort in in that. And we will be getting in the same range or maybe just lower, a tad lower than other channels because we are putting in that effort, but that is coming at a much higher claim settlement than many other areas.

And we've rapidly acquired customers on the PB Money side. That allows, of course, for, you know, more curated products and better risk. The other bit to this is that, I think savings is a large area. We do a lot of savings through insurance on the policy side. There is an opportunity to do savings on the Paisabazaar side through bonds, fixed deposits, mutual funds. So that's, that opportunity exists. And I think PB Money will be the backbone to use the data to advise customers on how to manage money better, and that should be a rapid area of growth for us this year.\" \"So monetization largely will come from selling, this year largely bonds and fixed deposits.

One is really a desktop stage in terms of which segment, which price point, what margin, what's the right to win, what's the sort of concept that will work with a consumer. It could take anything between six months to a year. It's backed by research, it's backed by firsthand insighting, it's backed by getting a better understanding of what will get us a right to win. The second phase really is packaging concept development, where it could take maybe up to another six months. Commercial production could take another three months. So pretty much, it could be between 18 months, plus or minus, from an idea to a physical form in which the product is available. The third phase really is actual product testing. In parallel, of course, we are doing the blend development. The third phase is really product testing, both on blend, packaging, and additionally communication design and communication testing. These are three phases. The fourth one that we follow as a discipline is we pick up two or three markets and we do a prototype launch, like we've done for Iconiq currently. As an example, with the prototype launch, we were selling it in Haryana, UP, and in a market in the East, and we like to build what we call a playbook. Essentially, the idea is to make sure that as we scale the brand, we are reasonably sure of return on investment. Once we believe that we have a playbook is when we start expanding into other markets, other core markets, which could take—depending on the label approval cycle because each state has its own requirement and some states' windows open at different times of the period—up to 12 months. Then the fifth stage really is scaling up the brand. So broadly from start to finish, it could be about a three-year affair from the time you conceive an idea to the time you actually launch it and then scale it up. For that purpose, having a robust pipeline of new products is extremely important because the market or the consumer would only get to see it when you launch it, but for us to be able to come to that point of launch, it could take up to 18 months.",

Most certainly, the wholesale price was anyway coming down continuously, and it continues to drop. And I think that will not stop, because even automation will happen and many other tech developments and productivity developments will push costs down like any tech product. But interestingly, even on the retail side… many of the players were retailing LGD products at roughly ₹60,000 to ₹50,000 a carat. That has now come down to ₹30,000 for many players, barring one or two players who have continUED to retail it at ₹60,000. And there are new players coming in all the time. So, our estimate is that the market will continue to drop the retail price of LGD per carat, and that will make it much, much more affordable. And I'm not sure how the unit economics is going to play out for a bunch of these players, unless we see a large number of totally new buyers coming into studded. Which, of course, if it happens, is great news for the industry, overall. So, it is a choppy situation. But nevertheless, even at ₹30,000 rupees a carat retail price, the markups are quite healthy. So, I suspect there will be more price warriors who may come in.",

Now, some of it is us vacating price points, because, simply, gold price goes up, the same product goes into a certain higher price band. That is one part of the story. But there is continued, let's say, customer sentiment in that lower price band, where we are seeing some buyers being a little reticent. Second piece is, yes, customers are more open to 18-karat gold. Though we don't really have the full information as yet. We've just launched some collections in 18-karat gold in certain parts of the country for traditional customers as well. And we hope that we'll see good response. And I know that in CaratLane, we've launched something in 9-karats as well. So there is early traction and I think more and more customers are going to be open to lower karatage simply because the price point has become quite a bit. On the higher price bands, while there is buyer growth, we are seeing some of the customers actually scaling down the complexity of product they are willing to buy.

So they were facing challenges around financial closure of their HAM projects, they were facing challenges around even once they're getting started, because they've been bid at some really ridiculous numbers, they were seeing challenges in progress. So I think there has been a rethink within the government that they don't want to make a repeat of the 2009-10-11 era where a lot of players came in and the government got great deals but none of those deals actually materialized. So I think there has been a rethink in the government that they don't want to have that because then it's a problem that they will have to again solve, whether it's for banks or whether it will be for the industry. And ultimately the net loser in that whole scheme is the government if they have to recapitalize the banks, if they have to solve for projects that are not done, escalated cost of projects. So I think all of that rethinking is happening. Precisely which is where there is an improvement in the qualification criteria that they're doing now.

The government has taken notice of the challenges that they have faced because of reducing their credentials criteria for bidding of projects. They have really struggled to get projects off the ground and also have started struggling on the construction quality front. So very recently, about a week or so ago, they have changed on the EPC model and made the criteria, eligibility criteria more stringent. Similar steps are expected in the HAM model as well. So we are expecting now that the competition should be more moderate. If you look at last year's data, in HAM 91% of projects were won by non-recognized or the smaller players - 91%, let that sink in. And in EPC, that number is even higher. So while the government has awarded these projects at record low prices, there is definitely certain question marks on the quality and the project progress that they'll be able to achieve. Hence, they have taken these corrective measures. So we are hoping that flows in line in this financial year.",

I think the way to think about this is there is a meeting this week. I don't think a trade deal would necessarily come out of one meeting, but if a de-escalation was to happen, it is not unlikely that there would be a catch-up effect where at some point the situation resolves itself and then you see much stronger demand coming out of China. What's important to realize is there is for some products some makeup capacity elsewhere to source your goods, but there are also certain goods where alternatives are either non-existent or fairly limited.

By fostering a culture of reflexive AI usage, our teams default to using AI first, reflexive being the key term here. This also means that before requesting additional headcount or resources, teams are required to start with assessing how they can meet their goals using AI first. This approach is sparking some really fascinating explorations and discussions around the company, challenging the way we think, the way we operate, and pushing us to look ahead as we redefine our decision making processes. In the past couple of weeks, we built a dozen MCP servers that make Shopify's work legible and accessible. And now anyone within Shopify can ask questions, find resources, and leverage those tools for greater efficiency.” - Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify \"Merchants' pivots in response to trade concerns are wide ranging, including decisions on inventory strategies, pricing changes, and sourcing selections. Consider pricing as one example. While some merchants have raised prices, we haven't seen broad based price increases yet. However, there remains a mix of strategies at play to navigate tariffs beyond just pricing. Merchants are considering when to change sourcing countries, when to buy inventory, or even adjusting product mix in their catalogs. From an end buyer perspective, in 2024, we had over 875,000,000 unique online shoppers, spanning a broad range of income levels and brand loyalties. While all merchants proudly serve consumers across all income brackets, their buyer base skews towards higher income consumers with more than half of their buyers in The US having incomes exceeding a hundred thousand dollars. We believe this helps insulate our merchants from some of the potential swings in pricing or other market factors as higher income consumers tend to be less price sensitive.",

Global cotton prices on the New York futures range from 65 to 68 cents per pound resulting in landed costs of about 76 to 78 US cents for mills in regions like Vietnam or Indonesia, whereas for us Indian mills they trade at 80 to 84 US cents per pound which is a cost disadvantage. This cost disadvantage is now eased by the government relaxing the 11% import duty for the time being.",

    "text": "Akash, thank you for your questions. The first one relates to what is the demand supply situation evolving in India? I think the first thing that we need to understand and when we put all of these numbers in place, there is a DC capacity and then there is AC capacity and what we need to provide to go to the grid that has about anywhere between 1.3 to 1.4 times difference. So, let’s say I need to add 40 gigawatts on the grid, it actually translates to around 60 to 65 gigawatts of solar panels. And then when you convert it into, let us say, capacity utilization of a typical plant that you have to add another factor of around somewhere around 15% to 20%. So then you are already hovering around, from a module perspective a demand translated into capacity terms around 70–75 odd gigawatts. That’s number one. Number two, in the out years, if you consider 237 odd gigawatts of solar that we need to deploy by 2030 the demand is actually going up. And in the out years, you will see that it is actually going to go to 50, 60, maybe even higher in terms of gigawatts. And what is not factored in there is the potential rise, which will be caused because of two factors, one is data centers and the other one is green hydrogen. So, that is going to add to the demand further. So, if you look into the crystal ball, the demand is actually going to be much higher than what we see at this point in time. So, that’s the demand side. Now, on the supply side, most of these projects will demand cells, which are made in India and increasingly ingots and wafers, which are also made in India. And so the market dynamics is going to be completely altered. The companies which are more and more backward integrated will have the highest chance of success as we move forward, because as a nation, we are moving towards Atmanirbharta.",

We must also realize that the liquidity scenario in the economy has loosened up further with the repo rates coming down. I think we can expect interest rates to only go southwards. Having said this, we are very conscious of the fact that we have been fundamentally involved in the power sector for a long time. We have unique capabilities and unique perspectives with regard to the power sector. Fundamentally, we are looking at 3 or 4 major interventions. Number one , we are really going to incentivize the construction part of the project finance. As on date, generally there are no incentives in place for any player, whether it is a state player or a private player, to incentivize early completion of projects. So that is one area which we hope to target in the days to come. The second is the option of refinancing. The option of refinancing, once scheduled, COD (Commercial Operation Date) has been achieved. That is another option that we are looking at. We are also looking at streamlining and liberalizing the ease of doing business with respect to our guidelines. I think a combination of all these 3 parameters will make an interest rate reduction an irrelevant consideration. I'm hopeful that once our guidelines have been further liberalized, once our incentive mechanisms have been put in place, people are not going to look at interest rate advantages. Rather, they will look at ease of doing business because as we know, there are a lot of imponderables in the power sector... I think REC is uniquely placed with its past profile, with its expert entity appraisal process, I think the interest rate consideration may not be very relevant in the year to come.",

So the disbursement and the prepayments both are flowing in the same way. \" – Harsh Baweja, Director, Finance \"Regarding disbursement in the distribution segment...

But if we see an opportunity to gain share, and improve our long-term competitive position, then we go for it, right? So in 99Acres, we've gained some share in the last six months, and we are continuing on that path. Now if revenue growth is solid, then it's not as if we will lose money, we would want to make money. But if revenue growth lags by a couple of quarters, we'll still go for share.",
    "context": "After years of focusing on reducing losses and reaching cash breakeven , they now explicitly state a willingness to sacrifice near-term profitability in 99acres to capitalize on a perceived opportunity to gain significant market share.",

We have increased our focus on acquiring small and medium enterprises as customers. We have these adjacent businesses and we are trying to penetrate the market more with those offerings... So I think it's a combination of three, four things. As far as IT services companies go, I've been saying this. What happened post COVID was that many of them ended up over hiring, and they built up a big bench. And therefore, they stopped hiring for a while. And they got rid of their benches. And at least now, even if they're not growing headcount, they have to replace the people who are leaving. Our hiring and our revenue is a function of attrition. So gross hiring, not necessarily net hiring. ...So my sense is that at least IT service company, most of them are at a point where their attrition rates have stabilized, they are replacing the people who are leaving, they may not be adding a lot of headcount... And of course, we have the cheapest way to hire. And in a modest environment, companies have some time to hire. So they would ideally not want to spend on recruitment firms, which are a lot more expensive way of hiring. So perhaps we are gaining some share also, hard for me to say.",

So there is a size that customers are keep buying with the exchange facilities what most of the jewelers are offering them. So that is one way we are able to sell. But till then there is if you look into last 6 months alone we see a price which has been gone up by more than 2,200 rupees per gram. If you look into 2020 the gold price was 4,500 in 5 years it has come up to 10,150 which is more than double the price. The one who has been earlier buying have a good chance of getting more money but still then there are little slowness as I said 25% still there is a less in volume then we can cover it with the revenue what each jewelers are making.",

In 23-24, it tapered primarily due to loss of two major customers due to mine closure and maintenance. And as I recently mentioned about the contingent deferred liability, it is linked to the reopening of those mines and those contracts and margins coming back into the business. If I was to normalize the year for those two mines that closed, that's actually been a growth year for them, both 23 and 24. And as far as the high-chrome cast media strategy, we have a medium to long-term view on high-chrome cast media. We have expanded capacity in Molycop in high-chrome cast media.

That was basically 100% concentrated in IEX earlier. Now, with this coupling thing happening, the exchange which is able to provide better services to the clients, the exchange which has got better connect with the clients, someone who has got a better technology platform, would possibly have a real shot to earn some volumes out of that market.

This way, we’ve been able to reduce risk without sacrificing volumes. We’re now on version three of the system. Initially, it processed 100 transactions per second. Today, it handles 1,400 per second. It’s evolving, and we’ll keep improving it.",

So, when we realign the book, both in terms of the bulk deposit and the fine price book, so obviously there is a bit of realignment. Having said so, as I said, on the corporate side, I mean, those corporates having a very strong cashflow position. I mean, there is a deleveraging, we need to take a note of that. And, secondly, because of significant downward movement in rates in the bond market, I mean, typically these corporates are also able to raise funds at a cheaper rate. So, obviously, the dependency on the bank's loans is relatively low. So, these are the two factors which are impacting. But as I said, June last year we had a 2.5% YoY and the full year we had a 9%.

Whereas in March, the growth was 14.2%. So, clearly, in the last one year we have upsized the growth in MSME. Clearly, we have done multiple aspects therein. We have put in a Cash Management System for MSME borrowers. A couple of sectors which are doing well for us is a sector like CV & CME, supply chain finance, the TReDs, I mean, the platform. So, the core MSME growth is also there. So, the bank will be focusing. And, again, on the regulation side, the MSME definition has changed now and that gives a huge opportunity for us to grow in MSME. Secondly, the government has come up with a couple of new schemes on the MSME. One is a cashflow-based scheme, which is a smart OD that we have already rolled out to the market. Another is MCGS, which is a guarantee-scheme under which you can lend money. So, I think, the environment for lending to MSME is quite positive at this point of time. There are demands. We have leveraged our digital platform. We rolled out the digital platform. We rolled out almost 350 branches, which are MSME-focused branches. We are focusing on clusters on MSME. So, with all this, I think growing at around 17%-18% is possible for the bank. And we are expecting rather to upsize that. So, we are working strongly on the MSME, focusing key to the MSME.",

So, again, H1 is a slack season and H2 is a busy season, right. So, the demand as such would come back in the H2 and by that time, the differential rate between the, let’s say, the bond market and the loan pricing would again get squished, right. That is what a transition we are looking that to happen in Q2 itself. So, in that scenario, I think people would come back strongly into the loan market and for us to optimize that. And as of today, if you look at a pipeline, we have a huge pipeline in order. Almost like cases which are sanctioned, not disbursed is almost 30,000-35,000 crore. Cases we are under consideration is almost 25,000-30,000 crore. So, we are going to replicate the same way that we did last year in terms of the Q1 growth slightly lower, but subsequently upsizing the growth in Q2, Q3 and Q4. And typically looking at a scenario where the demands are coming strongly on the renewable side, the data center side, whether it is a road project side. There are multiple sectors where the demands are still very strong and I think we will be in a position to achieve 9-10% corporate growth for the full year.",

It has been the SSM model which has been in vogue now in comparison to the previous model of PMFBY scheme where the liability was 250%. Whereas in this SSM model the cap is at 110% or 130% which is usually chosen by various states. So that is where the premium has come down and it has come down by more than 50-60% because the exposure is less, the insurance companies try to pass on the benefit on the premium front to the state insurers. For example, for a state like Maharashtra where the premium goes up to ₹10-12,000 crores they have now opted for SSM model wherein the loss cap is kept at 110%. So naturally the premium will come down by 50 to 60%.",

The sluggish demand environment (especially on discretionary spends) 2. Shortage (temporary) of delivery partners due to high demand of delivery partners in quick commerce given the rapid expansion of the industry in the last few months 3. Competition from quick delivery of packaged food from quick commerce leading to drop in demand for food delivery from restaurants On top of these, in this quarter, two other factors impacted growth – 1. We delisted ~19,000 restaurants who either a) did not pass muster on hygiene standards based on severe customer escalations, b) were mimicking established brands and misleading customers, or c) operating multiple identical menu listings to hog more listing impressions. As one of the leading food delivery platforms, we think it is critical to weed out bad actors which erode trust in the category. While this did impact order volumes, this was the right thing to do for the long term. 2. There was one less day in Q4FY25 compared to the same period last year (which was a leap year). Adjusted for the above two specific factors, NOV growth could have been higher by about 2 percentage points.

The second half can be better and the next year can be glorious I can say. I am doubtful about the US entry of dairy products into India.
